Your goal is to write 3-4 page report on an individual performance metric.
Find an indivudual performance metric for any team game you like
Describe its pro's and cons
In your analysis use vizualizations, 
calculate correlations with other metrics,
use some kind of modeling

The report needs to be done in r markdown. For all your chunsk, in chunk options, set echo=F
```{r, echo=F}

```

This will ensure that the R code will not appear in your final pdf report. The pdf report should be 3-4 pages without R code.
